# Voice-Interface-Project
This is a prototype for a website developed while working with a College of Design Professor.
It has several features includeding converting speech-to-text, displaying the transcript on the webpage, and formatting the text using voice commands. It also uses voice recognition to get a word/phrase from the user and displays the latest news containing those words by integrating with a news API.
